  <br>
    <ul>
     
      <li><strong>1879: </strong>born in Kingdom of Württemberg on March 14
      </li>
      <li><strong>1908: </strong>was recognized as an outstanding scientist and was appointed professor at the University of Bern</li>
       <li><strong>1911: </strong>
Einstein used his 1907 equivalence principle to calculate the deflection of light from another star by the Sun's gravity</li>
      <li><strong>1912: </strong> regresó a su alma mater en Zúrich. Desde 1912 hasta 1914 fue profesor de física teórica en la ETH de Zúrich</li>
      <li><strong>1913: </strong>Einstein improved on those calculations by using Riemannian spacetime to represent the gravity field.</li>
      
      <li><strong>1916: </strong>Einstein was elected president of the German Physical Society (1916-1918)</li>
      
      <li><strong>1919: </strong>
the leading British newspaper The Times ran a headline that read: "Revolution in Science - New Theory of Universe - Newtonian Ideas Overthrown."</li>
      <li><strong>1920: </strong>he became a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.</li>
      <li><strong>1922: </strong>he was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect".</li>
      <li><strong>1921: </strong>Einstein fue elegido miembro extranjero de la Royal Society (ForMemRS)</li>
      <li><strong>From 1922 to 1932: </strong>Einstein was a member of the International Committee for Intellectual Cooperation of the League of Nations in Geneva (with a few months of interruption in 1923-1924), an organization created to promote international exchange between scientists, researchers, teachers, artists and intellectuals.</li>
      <li><strong>1955: </strong>Albert Einstein experienced internal bleeding caused by a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, which had previously been surgically tightened by Dr. Rudolph Nissen in 1948. Einstein refused surgery, saying: 'I want to go when I want. It is bad taste to artificially prolong life. I've done my part, it's time to go. I will do it gracefully.’</li>
      <p><strong>“A human being is part of the whole we call the universe, a part limited in time and space. He is convinced that he himself, his thoughts and feelings are something independent of others, a kind of optical illusion of his consciousness. That illusion is a prison for us, it limits us to our personal desires and to feeling affection for the few closest to us. Our task has to be to free ourselves from that prison, widening our circle of compassion, to encompass all living beings and all of nature".</></strong>

      <p><strong>...In honor of his wonderful legacy. Albert Einstein
